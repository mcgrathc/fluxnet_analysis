## GitHub Repo for preliminary analysis for FLUXNET wetland sites with existing soil data

Seasonality plots of both monthly mean and all time (daily) flux are provided. The corrplots for the soil properties and the CH4 flux are also provided. 

Flux data is from the	[FLUXNET-CH4 Community Product]https://fluxnet.org/data/download-data/

Soil data was found through literaure and existing databases

**Note:**  There is a need for more sites to gather soil data in the years of flux measurements. Most sites have an inital characterization but lack soil data that corresponding with the sampling years for the flux data. This leaves very little room for quality analysis of the drivers of CH4 flux in soil.
